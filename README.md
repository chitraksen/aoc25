# Advent of Code 2025
- [aoc25](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

I've installed [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for formatting, but all logic will be vanilla python3.11.

## Prerequisites
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Usage

For the day 1 solution:

```bash
uv run main.py day1
```

or

```bash
uv run main.py 1
```

Change to a different day number to run that solution instead.

Additionally, make sure your puzzle input is saved to `data/day1` to get the day 1 solution, and so on and so forth.
